# TODO
- [X] Discuss splitting edge node provisioning, and edge application deployment into different labs
    - EG; https://github.com/ahussey-redhat/device-edge-workshops focuses on the device deployment, and;
    - https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/rhte-edge-lab-sno focuses on application deployment
    - This should reduce the overall time it takes to complete the full lab, as 90mins is not nearly enough time to; provision and configure edge clusters, and deploy applications
- [ ] Add input field for student number. Use the input field to pre-populate student number in resources
